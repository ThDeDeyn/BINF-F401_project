[Computational Methods for Genomics]

ex: cancerous cells have a higher production rate than regular cells -> violate normalization hypothesis

"Alignment is hte prerequisite for a wide range of investigations"

--> Alternative splicing
--> ...


Thyroid metabolism 
--> Some cancers acts on the matabolism -> cancer grows and stops metabolic function

Problem of multiple comparisons in PubMed ? We we always find a link between cancer and a mod in genome since it is a very studied field. 

Moderated t-stat: constant s0 prevents the t-stat from becoming too small when low variation genes are observed (sigma² = 0)

"The number of samples needed to reliably detect diff expression is computable"
--> Most of the studies reach a plateau with less than 10 / 30 samples


[Summary of the course : 13-03]


Functional Genomics is an extension of the central dogma; 

Today: focus on histology, which will be the focus of our project. Obj is to reuse the transcriptome Gtex sample and histological images.  
AI used, to see connections |b| gene expression and histological images. 

- Thanks to the web, genomics formed a lot of available data
  Several opportunities arose, due to the incredible amount of data. 
  A single experiment produces up to 10e4 != values, enough to allow ID of trends, biases ==> led to normalisation 

- Instead of looking for 1 gene, we can observe entire transcriptomes. 

- In fct genomics litt, lots of biases such as training & validation set not properly separated

- Importance of unbiased studies ==> as few hypothesis as possible (ex: of serum) 

- Clustering approach, linear or not (graph clustering). Also using dimensions reducing algorithm

-- Survival Analysis -- 
Idea: Several tracks of time, 
with cross representing death, machine breaking down 

Kaplan-Meyer curve: goes down every death
--> Above means better strength, better survival rate

Integration along time help shows longer survival time, even if everyone dies (not in exam ? --> Only Kaplan Meyer Curve) 

logrank test: assumes independent censoring --> Quite strong hypothesis made 
(ex coming from H: people leaving are not diying more) 

Cox regresion model: Asess the association of covariates

-- Application : predicting breast cancer outcome -- 
A tumor can cause cancer in the ~60 y.o but original mutation can be traced back in-utero
1/8 women

Previously: treatment was decided by dr. based on medical information 
Perhaps not the best treatment --> introduction of personalised medicine

Study 2003 sl. 40 Interesting bc transferable between cancers

Idea sl. 48-49: Remove the effect caused by cell proliferation, common in all cancers. Differences lies elsewhere

sl 52 play with oxygen as they did with serum

dutch signature? 


-- Failed research to better solutions -- 


PCNA: markers of cells growth and division 
GPS? 

--> Super PCNA: signature defined as the ones the top 1% most correlated with PCNA 
sl.9 cfr last week gene score --> shows high expression, high signal 

meta-PCNA used to evaluate proliferation-related signal ==> can be used to remove it form the study. 

sl.19 : takes the residuals == "Makes the line horizontal"
--> remove the signature associated with meta-PCNA (proliferation)
--> shows information obscured (2 greens dot, values was the same before residuals)

sl.21 should be a - bc we substracted.
sl.23 
detection of real potentially prognostic variables, 
after correction due to proliferation, classifier are not working anymore. 
All those scores were recording the proliferation markers

sl.24 --> Gros flex, il a démontré que pleins d'indices sont useless, mais mesure la prolifération. One paper had to be retracted, flex #2

sl.26
noir : tout les gènes 
rouge : en ne prenant que les gènes liés au cancer du sein. 

sl.30 --> tentative par l'absurde de montrer que tout profile peut marcher
Prends des profils random, sans liens et montre que les tests montrent une différence statistiquement significative. Intérêt ? Pas suivi

sl.36 --> Compare résultats avec des signatures random. Dans certains cas, la valeur observée n'est même pas dans les meilleurs 5%. 

sl.40-44 skipped
