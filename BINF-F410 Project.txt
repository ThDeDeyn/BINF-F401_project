[BINF-F410 Project]

1. Written exam --> open book exam of 2 hours. 

2. Project --> mini-research project evaluated from a written report, collective grade 
Tissue morphology is a branch of pathology --> using microscopy 
Microscopy has evolved a lot, still analysis of histopahological images have not. It is mostly driven by qualitative and subjective crieterias. 
=> Huge obstacle to proper treatment bc depends on pathologist. 

Our project: part of Canguilhem study

Q1 Clinical Variables 
1. How are they distributed ? 
2. Are they correlated ?
3. Are some technical variables possibly confounding demographic/ health variables ? 
Check slides for hint. 

Q2 Clinical data vs: morphology 

1. Compute systematically associations between clinical variables and morphological cluster counts. The purpose is to compare the magnitude of the associations of the different variables with morphology. 
2. Discuss association with technical variables
3. For non-technical variables, redo the analysis with adjustment for the confounding tech variables, if any is reported in Q2.2. Report and discuss significant associations.
